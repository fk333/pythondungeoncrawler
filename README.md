Dungeon crawler game
Text based dungeon crawler with one on one combat. Based on a d100 combat system of attack and parry.
I see 3 main areas to work on with combat mechanics being priority (core loop). Hero stats will ad depths to the core combat and replayability.

1.	Combat
Basic loop – att, parry, hit - DONE
Health damage - DONE
Variable damage d8, d10 etc - DONE
Stances increase/decrease att or parry - DONE
Combat points - 
Environmental debuffs



2.	Hero stats – variable att, parry chances, health
Weapons – att/parry chance increase 
Enemy stats randomisation 
Enemy attack randomisation 
Items – potions for health, damage etc 


3.	Dungeon (movement)
To be determined
